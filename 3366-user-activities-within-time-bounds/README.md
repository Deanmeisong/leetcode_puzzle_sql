| 101     | 2023-11-01 08:00:00 | 2023-11-01 09:00:00 | 1          | Viewer       |

<strong>Output:</strong> 
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 102     |
| 103     |
+---------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- User ID 101 will not be included in the final output as they do not have any consecutive sessions of the same session type.
- User ID 102 will be included in the final output as they had two viewer sessions with session IDs 3 and 4, respectively, and the time gap between them was less than 12 hours.
- User ID 103 participated in two viewer sessions with a gap of less than 12 hours between them, identified by session IDs 10 and 11. Therefore, user 103 will be included in the final output.
Output table is ordered by user_id in increasing order.
